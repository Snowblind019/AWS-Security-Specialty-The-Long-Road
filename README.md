This repository documents my journey to pass the AWS Certified Security Specialty exam.

It's not the journey I thought it would be.

## Attempt #1: September 15th, 2025

I failed.

Not close. Just... failed.

I thought I was ready. I'd done Stephane Maarek's course, Adrian Cantrill's deep dives, hundreds of practice questions. I knew the services. I understood the concepts. Or at least I thought I did.

The exam proved otherwise.

But that failure taught me something: **I wasn't preparing to understand AWS security. I was preparing to pass a test.** And those aren't the same thing.

So I changed my approach. I started diagramming services. I rebuilt my understanding from first principles. I focused on *why* things work the way they do, not just *what* they do.

I convinced myself that this time, I'd actually learned the lesson.

## Attempt #2: November 4th, 2025

I failed again.

This one hurt more because I'd done everything "right." I'd studied differently. I'd gone deeper. I'd put in the work.

But here's what I missed: **understanding theory isn't the same as being able to implement it.**

I could explain how KMS works. I could diagram GuardDuty's architecture. But when the exam threw me scenarios involving Python automation, Terraform deployments, or SQL-based log analysis — tools I'd heard of but never actually used — I realized my knowledge was still one layer too shallow.

I knew *about* these things. I didn't know how to *do* them.

That's what's changing now.

## What Happens Next

The SCS-C03 exam launches in December. That gives me time — real time — to stop studying for an exam and start training for a career.

Here's the plan:

**Stop reading. Start building.**
- Write Python scripts for security automation
- Deploy infrastructure with Terraform
- Build actual AWS environments and secure them
- Analyze CloudTrail logs with SQL
- Create real projects, not just follow tutorials

**Visual learning that works:**
- Diagram every service I touch in Lucidchart
- Document architectures in plain language
- Build a reference library I can actually use
- (You'll see winter-themed names like Snowy, Winterday, and Blizzard throughout — it's just how my brain organizes examples)

**Go from theory to implementation:**
- Not "what does this service do" → "when would I use this and how would I deploy it"
- Not "what are the features" → "how do I secure this in production"
- Not "can I pass the exam" → "can I do the job"

## Update – November 2025

Work priorities shifted unexpectedly and pulled my focus elsewhere for the past few weeks. The AWS SCS is on hold for now — not the direction I planned, but sometimes that's how it goes.

Once things settle, I'll be back to finish what I started here. Probably with a clearer head after the break.

The SCS journey isn't over. Just hitting pause.

## Update – December 2025

Work priorities shifted unexpectedly and pulled my focus elsewhere for the past few weeks. The AWS SCS journey was put on hold — not the direction I planned, but sometimes that's how it goes.

I'm back now. And I'm actually doing the thing I said I'd do.

I am first learning Python, Terraform, and SQL, and then putting it into practice and building with them.

Projects I will be working on:

- S3 Security Auditor — Python script to scan buckets for public access, missing encryption, disabled logging
- Security Group Auditor — Python script to find overly permissive rules and unused groups
- CloudTrail Log Analyzer — Python and SQL to analyze CloudTrail logs for security events and suspicious activity

This repository will update as I go. No timeline. Just progress.

## Why I'm Still Here

I could have quit after the first failure. I definitely thought about quitting after the second.

But someone once said that brick walls aren't there to keep us out. They're there to show how badly we want something — to stop the people who don't want it badly enough.

I want this badly enough to fail twice and keep building.

> *"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."*  
> — Winston Churchill

This repository started as a way to document my second attempt.  
Now it's proof that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get this right — even if it means admitting I was wrong, starting over, and failing again before I succeed.

I don't know how long this will take. But I know I'm not stopping until I get there.

By the Will of the Lord, I'll pass the SCS-C03. And when I do, I'll actually be ready for what comes next.
