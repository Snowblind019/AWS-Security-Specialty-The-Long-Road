On September 15th, 2025, I took my first attempt at the AWS Certified Security – Specialty exam.
I didn’t get the result I wanted — but I got something better.

What I gained was more valuable than a passing score: I discovered exactly where my understanding needed to grow.

> Failure didn’t stop me. It started something deeper: real understanding.

This isn’t the end of the story — it’s the chapter where I get back up.

This repository documents my second attempt. Not as a simple retry, but as a **rebuild** — a re-architecture of everything I thought I knew, and everything I didn’t. I’ll be diagramming, annotating, and explaining every area I struggled with — and even the areas I did well in — until I reach a level of clarity, instinct, and muscle memory that goes far beyond exam prep.

> If it confused me on the exam, it’s going on a whiteboard and getting diagrammed to death.

So what changed? My mindset.
I realized passing the test isn’t the goal — **mastery** is.
I’m not studying for a badge. I’m studying for the moment someone depends on me to solve a real problem.

This repo isn’t about proving I’m smart.
It’s about proving I don’t quit.

Thanks for being part of the journey.
Whether you're on your first attempt or your fifth — keep going.

> You're never a failure unless you start blaming others.
> Own your mistakes. Learn from them. Fix them.
> **And do the work — so next time, there’s nothing left to blame.**

## What's Next

Here’s the plan:
I’m taking every domain in the AWS SCS blueprint and diving **deep** into it. I’m not just reviewing — I’m rebuilding my mental model from the ground up.

- I’ll create detailed **Lucidchart diagrams** for each service and concept
- I’ll explain everything in **my own words**, using real-world analogies where possible
- I’ll repeat the process until I can confidently say: *I don’t just know it — I understand it*

By the Will of the Lord, when the time comes to retake the exam, my goal is to understand every core AWS security service at a **low level** — how it works, how it integrates, and how it protects real-world systems — both **theoretically and visually**

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step — and the hardest one is always the first.
So here it is. **Step one. Let’s go.**
